                            <p> In a sentence, Project Y is my attempt at characterizing the acoustic field generated by a supersonic flow. I designed and developed an electromechanical system to rotate a diamond-shaped nozzle while simultaneously exhausting supersonic flow at Mach 2 and collecting data. Initially, the tests will collect acoustic data while the jet is "cold". After that, I'll move on to visualizing the flow using a technique known as PIV(Particle Image Velocimetry). Finally, the upstream air supply will go through a combustion process until it reaches 1700°F(~930 °C) and I can collect heated jet noise and flow visualization to characterize the features of this unique nozzle geometry.</p>

                            <p> I was introduced to jet acoustics when I started graduate school. I had gotten to explore the Anechoic Hot Jet facility at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering and sampled some experiments using a tradiational round nozzle. When I was introduced to this diamond nozzle, I went through the same type of tests. I placed it in the anechoic facility, fired it up, and recorded the noise in two configurations. The first, where the longer (major) axis of the nozzle was in-line with the far-field microphone array. Then I would rotate the nozzle 90° and record noise when the other axis was on the same plane as the mics.</p>

                            <p> Since my academic career was going to be based on this, non-axisymmetric, diamond shaped supersonic nozzle; I realized that recording the noise and visualizing flow from these 2 perspectives wasn't quite enough. Hence, Project Y was born. I was discussing research goals and how I wanted to rotate the nozzle and peak at the flow/acoustics from a ton of different perspectives when   <a href="https://zigunov.com/author/zigunov/">Dr. Fernando Zigunov</a> (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hBTYbRAAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" style="color:#F57251;">Scholar</a>) mentioned that rather than reset the experiment everytime I wanted to rotate the nozzle, I could automate the process. The first thing we did was discuss how we could make this mechanism without forcing a rigorous redesign of a facility that works ,for the most part, just fine.</p>

                            <p>Soon after that, I went straight to a CAD platform and started mocking up my rotation mechanism. This helped me figure how I wanted to move forward, but mostly, I hadn't used CAD software in a couple of years and this served as a fantastic refresher course. I started simple, I had two sprockets that were the exact same size at some set distance from each other. My initial goal was to assemble them using a chain. After a couple of attempts, I got a better hand on how to use CAD and had a neat animation to show off.</p>

                            <p>Now it was time for the real deal. I wanted to use hardware that, for the most part, could be found on a major supply company's website (McMaster-Carr). I scoured their site looking at a variety of sprockets, shafts, chains, and tensioners. I downloaded a couple of the CAD files available and would build it together. After a few iterations, I found  the sprocket/chain size that was "just right" for my purpose and started to make a more rigorous assembly. My peer Serdar Seckin (Scholar) played a significant role while I was developing my setup and bringing it all together. When all was said and done, only two parts of the assembly had to be made from scratch in a machine shop which kept costs down. The plans were ready and it was almost time for assembly. Below are a pair of images illustrating the full assembly design before purchasing any products</p>

                        <div class="blog-content">

                            <p> Soon after that, I installed it in the anechoic chamber and put everything together. It was working! I spent the next few days playing around with the data acquisition & control code, spinning the nozzle from my computer, and doing a couple of dry tests. Finally, I was ready to try and run a full scale test. This is where I realized my first mistake.</p>
                        <div class="blog-image">
                            <img src="media/images/blog/Project Y/Project Y in Anechoic Chamber.jpg" alt="">

                        <blockquote>An image of the Project Y assembly in the anechoic chamber.</blockquote>

                            <p> My design had been working wonderfully during all of my dry runs, but the nozzle just would not rotate when I sent a command during testing! After some troubleshooting, I eventually figured out that even with my gear reduction, my motor could not generate enough torque to rotate the nozzle under load. "Well...now what?" I thought to myself. After a few minutes of panicking, I realized two things. The first, was that I could still build a three dimensional acoustic profile around my nozzle. The only caveat was that we would need to cycle through shutting down and starting up flow in the facility every time I wanted to rotate the nozzle; but hey, I could capture data and try to make my pretty acoustic surface plots. </p>
                        <div class="blog-image">

                        </div>

                        <p>Next, I figured that all I needed was a quick redesign! But first I would need to calculate how much torque I actually needed to rotate the nozzle once there was air flowing. Some internet browsing led me to the conclusion that trying to rotate a screw under load is not common practice in the world of engineering. I'd have to use some other model to estimate how much torque it takes to rotate my nozzle. I found three different resources on techniques I could use. The situation that most realistically matched my situation, was calculating the torque required to overcome static friction on a disc under load. From here, I could come up with a torque to design for. The solution seemed to be another torque multiplier. This time I was going to use a worm and its accompanying worm gear to increase torque.</p>

                        <div class="blog-image">
                            <img src="media/images/blog/Project Y/WormGearCAD.png" alt="">
                        <blockquote> An altered design to allow for much increased torque to rotate the nozzle during operation.</blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>With the worm and accompanying worm gear I picked, thee was a speed ratio of 30. On paper, this meant I had far more control/resolution over the rotation of my nozzle. To clarify this, let's start from the stepper motor and work our way out to the nozzle/large sprocket. The stepper motor takes 400 steps to rotate 360° as in, each step rotated the small sprocket attached to the motor by 0.9°. The small sprocket(made with 10 teeth) was attached via a chain to a larger sprocket(made with 40 teeth). The ratio of teeth also represents the gear ratio; hence, I was working with a gear ratio of 4. Now, it takes 1600(400x4) steps to rotate the  small sprocket 360° (0.225°/step). Now, this is where things get a little absurd with the worm/worm gear configuration. Given a speed reduction of 30, it would take 48,000(400*4*30) steps to rotate the nozzle by 360°(0.0075°/step). Once again, this is on paper. Realistically, the chain isn't always in tension, there's a little bit of backlash, and the system isn't perfectly rigid! However, this will be more than enough to run my experiments and collect some really cool data!</p>

                        <p>As nifty as it was to build this system; if I was really going to rotate this pipe and collect data while a supersonic jet was blasting out the end, I needed a way to make sure my nozzle was rotating as much as I was telling it to. The solution to that problem was to install a rotary encoder. The good news was that this is a relatively inexpensive device that was very accurate. The not so good news was that I had to figure out how the heck to mount this encoder onto an already designed assembly, integrate a new device into my system, and program it all to work together. After some soul searching, the fastest thing I could do was 3D print something I could slot into my build! Take a look below.</p>

                        <p>With my upgrades in place, I could take high resolution  acoustic measurements across various azimuthal planes! To try and keep things reasonable, I selected my increment in degrees to be 1.8°. That way, it would take 201 measurements to characterize the acoustics throughout the entire (360°) azimuthal plane! Now that I have a functional system, the next stop would be measurements and, finally, data visualization. In this next image, you can take a quick look at the results!</p>

                        <p> One of the magical things about high resolution microphones measurements is the ability to resolve the frequency of the acoustic waves observed! Using Project Y, I could take a look at the frequency content in an entire azimuthal plane! While the image above represents more of a global overview of the acoustics generated by this nozzle, the following image will tell you the frequency and amplitude of the acoustics radiated toward <b>one</b> particular microphone. In particular, the microphone sitting at the sideline!</p>

                        <p>I've taken to explaining the frequency spectral features in terms of geographic features since it’s a touch more intuitive. Let’s start from the low frequency content where you traverse the great plains of turbulent mixing noise. This progresses into sheer cliff screech tones. Beyond the fall-off, you see the mountainous build of BBSAN with harmonic tones forming the secondary peaks of this spectra.

                        <p>There's the story of Project Y and where it stands so far. I've left out a lot of the nitty-gritty stuff but I think I've gotten a good chunk of story out. I also managed to develop my 3D model quite a bit and integrate a full-scale model of the anechoic chamber that I use. <a href="media/CAD/Project Y/Sprocket and Chain V4_EncoderDrawing.html" style="color:#F57251;">Click here</a> to view an interactive full-scale 3D model of the hardware discussed here and <a href="media/CAD/HotJet_Assembly_MAIN_072023.html" style="color:#F57251;">click here </a> to check out how that was integrated into the anechoic chamber environment. This is a pretty large file so it may take a while to load.</p>
